// Notes:-
/* 1> Smart pointer is a class which wraps a raw pointer , to manage the life time of the pointer.
   2> The most fundamental job of smart pointer is to remove the chances of memory leak.
   3> It makes sure that the object is deleted if it is not reference anymore. */

// Types:- 
/* 1> Unique_ptr: 
              allows only one owner of the underlying pointer.

   2> Shared_ptr:
              alloes multiple owners of the same pointer(reference count is maintained) 

   3> Weak_ptr:
             It is special type of pointer which doesn't cout the refference. 

   4> Auto_ptr:
            special" dangerous ability to be copied â€” which also unexpectedly transfers ownership.
            Not work as a frsher. bcz only in c++ 11 and deplicated in c++ 17 */
